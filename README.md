- Lowest Performance: October had the weakest sales at around $120,000, with September and January also showing relatively low figures.
- 

- Seasonal Patterns: Rapid growth from January → February Sharp dip in March, followed by recovery through May and June Decline from July → October before rebounding in November and December possibly due to year-end sales.
