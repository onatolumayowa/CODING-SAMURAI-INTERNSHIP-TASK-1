# Online Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This project involves creating a basic sales performance dashboard for a small retail store to track and analyze key business metrics. The dashboard consolidates sales data into an easy-to-read, visual format, enabling store managers and owners to make informed business decisions quickly.

### Data Sources


### Tasks
- Calculate basic sales metrics like total revenue, average order value, and total sales.

- Removed unused columns
- Added new columns 'Total price' and 'Order Month'


### Analysis

1. Visualize trends using basic line and bar charts (e.g., monthly sales trends)

**Insights**

- Peak Months: February and May recorded the highest sales, both exceeding $800,000, likely driven by seasonal promotions or high-demand periods.
 

- Lowest Performance: October had the weakest sales at around $120,000, with September and January also showing relatively low figures.
  

- Seasonal Patterns: Rapid growth from January → February Sharp dip in March, followed by recovery through May and June Decline from July → October before rebounding in November and December possibly due to year-end sales.


- Volatility: Sales fluctuate significantly month-to-month, suggesting strong seasonality and dependence on campaigns or external factors.
 

**Recommendation**

Leverage strategies from high-performing months to boost off-season sales, and consider targeted promotions during historically low months (March, September, October).


2. Identify the top 3 products by sales and visualize them in a bar chart

**Insights**

- Tablet 10-inch leads by a wide margin with $3,230,000 in sales over three times the second-ranked product.
  

- Smartwatch ranks second at $910,000, performing well but with room to grow.


- Mechanical Keyboard comes third at $495,000, indicating niche demand but potential for targeted upselling.
  

**Observations**

- Sales are heavily concentrated in one product, presenting both high revenue potential and reliance risk. 

- Also the steep drop between 1st and 2nd place shows potential to diversify and boost mid-tier products.



**Recommendation**

Maintain strong marketing and supply for the Tablet 10-inch, while developing growth strategies for Smartwatch and Mechanical Keyboard to reduce dependency on a single product.


3. Visualize the monthly sales trends of the top 3 product

**Insights**

- Tablet 10-inch is the primary revenue driver almost every month, with particularly high sales in May, June, and July. This confirms its status as the store’s flagship product.

- Smartwatch has noticeable contributions in February, May, July, and August, boosting total monthly sales during these months. Minimal or no sales in some months (e.g., March, October, November), indicating inconsistent demand or stock issues.

- Mechanical Keyboard shows moderate sales in May, June, August, September, and December, with peaks aligning to multi-product high months. Very low or no contribution in the first quarter except for a small presence in March.


**Observations**

- Sales spikes occur when multiple products perform strongly together (e.g., May, June, July).

- Heavy reliance on Tablet 10-inch means months where it underperforms (e.g., October) see a steep drop in total sales.

- Smartwatch and Mechanical Keyboard act as secondary boosters but have inconsistent monthly performance.


**Recommendations**

- Strengthen promotions in months where only one product sells well to balance sales across all categories.

- Address Smartwatch’s inconsistent sales and investigate demand patterns or stock availability.

- Explore bundling or cross-selling Mechanical Keyboards with Tablets to lift its contribution during weaker months.
